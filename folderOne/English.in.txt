Essay on My working day
I start my day early in the morning. I usually get up at 7 a.m. and do things that everybody does at this time: washing, having breakfast and working out for 30 minutes. Also, I get my things, like a wallet, keys, backpack and a tablet, and leave home at about 9 o’clock. I don’t have a car that’s why I go to the bus stop and wait for the bus. It takes 50 minutes to get to my office by it.
My day at work is typical: phone calls, talking to people, answering emails, writing reports and discussing some important issues with my boss. So you can imagine that I have my hands full.
During the day we have a break for lunch. I usually eat in the kitchen with co-workers. Sometimes we play foosball, ping-pong, and video games. Then back to work. I usually leave at 7:15 p.m. After leaving my office I head to downtown where I have dinner with my best friend in our favorite cafe. Then straight from the cafe, I go to the supermarket to buy some food and go home.
While returning home in public transport I always read some interesting tales which I found on the web. I am at home at about half past nine. And the first thing that I have to do is to feed my hungry cat. After that, I can change into more comfortable clothes and prepare supper. I always have a lot of housework to do in the evening, I water the flowers, tidy up my flat and take a shower. Sometimes I watch TV series, Skype to my relatives and play hide-and-seek with my cat. At last, I go to bed at 12.
So now you know how I spend my working day.
